General TODOs
[?] check if check_auto can be removed from master controller (line 60 StateChangeHandler, line 82 && 129(?) Automation Controller)
[ ] check if assignment in MasterController set_XXXX_scene current_scene assignments are necessary, and if it should change
[ ] EventHandler augmented is messed up, streamline it
[ ] Set display logger level to info, but setup file for all logger output.
[ ] pressing camera scene lags almost a second before the app updates

Optimizations

Need TODOs
[*] Change StreamEvents "enum" to a set of constant strings for sending/receiving updates
[*] Like, actually use the timer classes callbacks???? Seriously? WHO WROTE THIS CODE!!! oh wait, that was me...

General
[*] double check every logger.debug statement if should be info instead
[*] StateChangeHandler self.MasterApp.States to self.states with a fine couthed tome
[*] double check socket handler for readability, but most importantly logger levels
[*] replace all dotDict uses, it's a little dumb
[*] make sure clicker send in obs takes flags
[*] remove MasterController.handle_state_change, have all calls processed directly by EventHandler
