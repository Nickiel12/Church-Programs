General TODOs
[ ] check if check_auto can be removed from master controller (line 60 StateChangeHandler, line 82 && 129(?) Automation Controller)
[ ] double check every logger.debug statement if should be info instead
[*] StateChangeHandler self.MasterApp.States to self.states with a fine couthed tome
[*] double check socket handler for readability, but most importantly logger levels
[ ] replace all dotDict uses, it's a little dumb
[ ] make sure clicker send in obs takes flags
[ ] check if assignment in MasterController set_XXXX_scene current_scene assignments are necessary, and if it should change
